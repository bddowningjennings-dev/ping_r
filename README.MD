Tech Review:

Please answer the questions below with no more than 3 sentences. There are no wrong answers, so don't be shy we really want to get to know you! :

<!-- - What is your favorite resteraunt?
Jusco Japanese Restaurant (in Davis, CA) because it has pretty good sushi but exxcccellent garlic-y, jalepeno-y fried calamari. Also, Ruchi Indian Cuisine - I'm a huge fan of Indian buffets and especially samosas and onion/spinach pakoras. And - to throw in a non-fried food emphasized option - any good pho place any day.

- What do you do for fun outside of work?
For non-programming/non-work related fun I like to go to plays or improv shows - I've had a few improv classes and I'm pretty terrible but it is still a lot of fun. I really enjoy bouldering and need to do it a lot more because I've gone a bit flabby what with all of the fried foods - also looking forward to starting yoga... one day. Oh, I really really love board games but I almost forgot to mention them because it has been too long since I've had regular games - I really want to try to get into DnD if I can find an inviting group.

- What is the last movie, tv show you saw or book you read and did you like it?
I have been visiting my brother's family and with his 6 year-old son I have been re-watching The Real Ghostbuster cartoon from the late 80's - early 90's and I'm loving it. The show really holds up! Plus, I get to watch Landyn get almost as into it as I did when I was his age.

- If you could pick a superpower what would it be and why?
Lazy, best power: Omnipotence.
Most fun power: Teleportation, I'm not a fan of traffic.
Worst power: Taffy Man, the ability to stretch your limbs (like Mr. Fantastic) but you cannot retract them... they only get longer/extend.

- Why and when did you learn how to program?
My first experience was an elective VB course in high school but, even though I really loved it, I didn't continue. I didn't go to college until much later, but my major did require some Numerical Analysis and Programming courses where I mostly used C++, python and Matlab. And a little over a year ago now I decided that I really wanted to program/make things to automate/solve problems so I began self-teaching and went to coding dojo for more formal structure.

- What is your preferred software to edit code?... tabs vs spaces…. Light vs dark...
I'm really digging VS Code (but surprisingly pretty happy with basic edits in vim). Tabs (set equal to 2 spaces), word wrap, autosave afterDelay. Dark - Material Neutral, VSCode icons.

Jusco Japanese Restaurant (in Davis, CA) because, while it has only pretty good sushi, it has exxcccellent (the best ever, really) garlic-y, jalapeno-y fried calamari. Also, Ruchi Indian Cuisine - I'm a huge fan of Indian buffets and especially unlimited samosas and onion/spinach pakoras. And - to throw in a non-fried food emphasized option - I'll gladly take any good pho place on any given day.
